Abstract
The New York City is known as Gotham, a city full of opportunities and dangers. For people living in it or will live in, have a deep understanding of how safe this city is, is somehow necessary. By analyzing the number of complaints in New York City, with complementary information such as offense levels, types of crime and the geological information of the place that each complaint occurred, we will draw a network of the relationship between precincts. Our goal is to identify the safety level of each precinct in New York City, find the typical offense level in high crime rate areas, and representative precincts using network analysis methods.
